# Berry-dots

My personal **dotfiles** for [Berrywm](https://berrywm.org)!  
These dotfiles are used, tested, and created on [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com) 20.1  

This is my first rice, so there may be some issues.

## Packages required:

The packages used are: `lxappearance, lemonbar, rofi, nitrogen, sxhkd, nemo, xed, berry`
I am using the `Lato` font.
These (except berry) can be installed using  `apt`, and are likely in other distro's repos as well.
Just copy all the folders in **this repo** to your `~/.config` directory, and bob's your uncle!
The wallpaper is from the `Linux Mint Ulyana/Ulyssa` artwork.

## Installation

1. Install berry, by following the instructions on **https://berrywm.org**
2. Install the packages and fonts listed in the above chapter
3. Run the **`install.sh`** located at the root of this repo
4. Log out and select the **`berry`** session 

## Thanks!

I hope you enjoy my rice!  
I encourage you to fork this and tweak it how you want!
