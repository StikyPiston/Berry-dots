# Berry-dots

My personal **dotfiles** for [Berrywm](https://berrywm.org)!  
These dotfiles are used, tested, and created on [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com) 20.1  

This is my first rice, so there may be some issues.

## Packages required:

The packages used are: `lxappearance, lemonbar, rofi, nitrogen, sxhkd, nemo, xed, berry`
I am using the `Lato` font.
These (except berry) can be installed using  `apt`, and are likely in other distro's repos as well.
Just copy all the folders in **this repo** to your `~/.config` directory, and bob's your uncle!

## Thanks!

I hope you enjoy my rice!  
I encourage you to fork this and tweak it how you want!
